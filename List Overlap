#List Overlap  
#Exercise 5 (and Solution)
#Take two lists, say for example these two: 
#and write a program that returns a list that contains 
# only the elements that are common between the lists 
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two 
# lists of different sizes.
# Extras:Randomly generate two lists to test this Write this in one line
#  of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure
#  this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon
import random

n = 10
n1= 7
list1 =random.sample(range(1,50),n)
list2 =random.sample(range(1,30),n1)
print(list1)
print(list2)

common = list(set(list1) & set(list2))

print(common)
